## SBWC WooCommerce Product Single Carousel Upsell

This plugin adds a carousel of upsell products to the single product page of WooCommerce. Owl Carousel 2 is used for the carousel. The carousel is only added if there are upsell products defined on the product edit screen under the Carousel Upsells tab. Support has been added for WooCommerce simple and variable products, as well as for products linked by variations plugin. If an upsell is a linked product, users will be redirected to the linked product page when clicking on the upsell in the carousel. Products are added to cart via AJAX as far as standard simple and variable products are concerned. If a product is a linked product, the user will be redirected to the linked product page when clicking on the Add to Cart button.
